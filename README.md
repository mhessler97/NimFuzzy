# NimFuzzy
A nim library for dealing with fuzzy logic. still very rudimentary but it at least works for the test case now
please let me know if you encounter any errors while working with it. 
currently any fuzzy rule you create can only use an `and` or `or` in it. check out the test file for a working example.
